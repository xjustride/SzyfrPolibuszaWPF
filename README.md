# Polybius Square Cipher Application

## Overview

This WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) desktop application, developed using .NET 6.0, leverages the Polybius Square cipher to encode and decode text. Adapting the traditional Polybius cipher to accommodate the Polish alphabet, this app innovatively caters to the modern use while respecting the essence of the age-old encryption method.

## Features

- **Text Encryption and Decryption**: Utilize the Polybius Square cipher method for encrypting plaintext into encoded text and vice versa.
- **Polish Alphabet Support**: Distinctively designed to accommodate the array of characters within the Polish alphabet, ensuring a smooth and error-free experience for the Polish language.
- **User-friendly WPF Design**: An intuitive and aesthetically designed application that is focused on ensuring an unparalleled interaction with the Polybius Square cipher.

## Requirements

- Windows OS compatible with WPF framework applications.
- .NET 6.0 SDK installed for the best utility of the console.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**: Begin by cloning the repository to your local system to acquire all the relevant installation packages and facilitate the local running of the project.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/xjustride/SzyfrPolibuszaWPF.git
    ```

2. **Open the Project**: You can open the `.sln` (solution) file using Visual Studio or any other IDE that is well-tailored for .NET 6.0 development, navigating to the solution directory.

3. **Compile the Project**: Initiate the application build in your IDE or command line interface using the following:

    ```
    dotnet build
    ```

4. **Run the WPF C# Application**: Start the pre-compiled version of the program or embark on a new build cycle, followed by launching the automaton, from your selected IDE or the .

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

## How to Use

1. **Entry of Plain/Cipher Text**: Populate the repository with the original text or encoded text.
2. **Determine the Key**: Confirm the matrix number used during the applicable article's content migration (the value should be non-zero).
3. **Encryption/Decryption**: Pave the path for the polybius journey through the prompted *Encrypt* or *Decrypt* position.
4. **Enumeration of the Computation**: The hosting library should finally stipulate the lightcast on the transformed text.
